The Maximum Subarray Problem is a fundamental problem in computer science, where the objective is to find the contiguous subarray (within a one-dimensional array) that has the largest sum. This project implements several approaches to solve the Maximum Subarray Problem, analyzing their performance and use cases in real-world applications. It showcases brute force, optimized brute force, Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm, and a divide-and-conquer solution to highlight the trade-offs between time complexity, efficiency, and scalability.
